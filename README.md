Machine learning project

Abstract—In this project, we are comparing two social media users and identifying which amongst them is more inﬂuential.The dataset contains the follower count and many other features of each user. By human judgement, the follower count is the only feature to categorize an user as inﬂuential or not but it takes more than just a high follower count to make an inﬂuencer. In this project, we consider other features to predict which user is more inﬂuential. The social media used here is Twitter. We are training the data using different models like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine and Gradient to predict which user is more inﬂuential. We also used techniques like cross validation and a combination of features to enhance the accuracies. We ﬁrst used the in-built library for predictions and then built a few models from scratch to match or improve the accuracy. Finally, we compared the results we got by different models and different techniques and combinations of models and techniques and also talked about how this project can be helpful in the future.
